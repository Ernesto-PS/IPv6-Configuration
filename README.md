# IPv6-Configuration

**Overview**

This project focuses on configuring IPv6 on Cisco routers to establish communication between networks. The routers start with no IPv6 configuration, requiring manual setup of IPv6 forwarding, WAN interfaces, and LAN interfaces. Additionally, network interfaces on connected computers will be configured to support IPv6 communication.
